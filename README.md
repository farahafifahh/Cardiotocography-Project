# Cardiotocography-Project
Cardiotocography (CTG) is a medical procedure to record fetal heartbeat and contractions of the uterus during pregnancy. CTG reading is significant to understand the condition of the foetus and prevent any mortality.

It is usually used in the third trimester to monitor foetal well- being and early detection of foetal distress. An abnormal CTG indicated the need for more invasive investigations and may lead to the need for emergency caesarian section.

Aim: The project aims to create a machine learning model that is able to accurately forecast foetal state.
